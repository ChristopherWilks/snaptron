We apply the approach to conducting the first systematic search for viruses in neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infancy. The diverse clinical progression of this disease as well as related epidemiological and virological findings are highly suggestive of a pathogenic cofactor. However, a viral etiology of neuroblastoma is currently contested. We mapped 14 transcriptomes of neuroblastoma as well as several positive control transcriptomes to the human and all known viral genomes in order to detect both known and unknown viruses.  Analysis of positive controls, comparisons with related methods, and statistical estimates demonstrate the high sensitivity of our approach. However, detailed analysis of putative vi- ral transcripts within neuroblastoma samples did not provide evidence for the existence of any known human viruses. Likewise, de-novo assembly and analysis of chimeric transcripts did not result in expression signatures associated with novel human pathogens. While confounding factors such as sample dilution or viral clearance in progressed tumors may mask viral cofactors in the data, in principle, this is rendered less likely by the high sensitivity of our approach and the number of biological replicates analyzed. Therefore, our results suggest that frequent viral cofactors of metastatic neuroblastoma are unlikely.

The presence of long introns (24 over 10kb long, 5 over 100kb long) poses challenges to the splicing machinery. Additionally, the heterogeneity in intron size suggests that intron removal not always takes place consecutively. We explored the order of intron removal and potential multi-step splicing for the DMD transcripts in human skeletal muscle cell lines. A customized library of probes (120bp) covering all exons and introns, has been generated capturing pre-mRNA and targeting DMD, followed by Hiseq sequencing. SplicePie pipeline has been used to analyze capture-pre-mRNA-sequencing data. Analysis showed that DMD introns can be removed non-sequentially generating exon blocks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ joined blocks of exons flanked by unspliced introns. Exon blocks were detected by analysis of the coverage of paired-end reads and validated experimentally using PCR and Sanger sequencing. No correlation between intron length and speed of intron removal was observed. Computational analysis and experimental validation revealed that intron removal takes place in several steps for the majority of dystrophin introns. We found two mechanisms of multi-step intron removal in DMDÃ¢â‚¬â€œ recursive and nested splicing. Non-sequential and multi-step splicing events were found throughout the DMD gene across three cell lines. We believe that our findings of non-sequential and multi-step splicing provide insight in the splicing mechanism and will be useful to optimize therapeutic strategies that interfere with the splicing process.

We apply the approach to conducting the first systematic search for viruses in neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infancy. The diverse clinical progression of this disease as well as related epidemiological and virological findings are highly suggestive of a pathogenic cofactor. However, a viral etiology of neuroblastoma is currently contested. We mapped 14 transcriptomes of neuroblastoma as well as several positive control transcriptomes to the human and all known viral genomes in order to detect both known and unknown viruses.  Analysis of positive controls, comparisons with related methods, and statistical estimates demonstrate the high sensitivity of our approach. However, detailed analysis of putative vi- ral transcripts within neuroblastoma samples did not provide evidence for the existence of any known human viruses. Likewise, de-novo assembly and analysis of chimeric transcripts did not result in expression signatures associated with novel human pathogens. While confounding factors such as sample dilution or viral clearance in progressed tumors may mask viral cofactors in the data, in principle, this is rendered less likely by the high sensitivity of our approach and the number of biological replicates analyzed. Therefore, our results suggest that frequent viral cofactors of metastatic neuroblastoma are unlikely.

The presence of long introns (24 over 10kb long, 5 over 100kb long) poses challenges to the splicing machinery. Additionally, the heterogeneity in intron size suggests that intron removal not always takes place consecutively. We explored the order of intron removal and potential multi-step splicing for the DMD transcripts in human skeletal muscle cell lines. A customized library of probes (120bp) covering all exons and introns, has been generated capturing pre-mRNA and targeting DMD, followed by Hiseq sequencing. SplicePie pipeline has been used to analyze capture-pre-mRNA-sequencing data. Analysis showed that DMD introns can be removed non-sequentially generating exon blocks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ joined blocks of exons flanked by unspliced introns. Exon blocks were detected by analysis of the coverage of paired-end reads and validated experimentally using PCR and Sanger sequencing. No correlation between intron length and speed of intron removal was observed. Computational analysis and experimental validation revealed that intron removal takes place in several steps for the majority of dystrophin introns. We found two mechanisms of multi-step intron removal in DMDÃ¢â‚¬â€œ recursive and nested splicing. Non-sequential and multi-step splicing events were found throughout the DMD gene across three cell lines. We believe that our findings of non-sequential and multi-step splicing provide insight in the splicing mechanism and will be useful to optimize therapeutic strategies that interfere with the splicing process.

The presence of long introns (24 over 10kb long, 5 over 100kb long) poses challenges to the splicing machinery. Additionally, the heterogeneity in intron size suggests that intron removal not always takes place consecutively. We explored the order of intron removal and potential multi-step splicing for the DMD transcripts in human skeletal muscle cell lines. A customized library of probes (120bp) covering all exons and introns, has been generated capturing pre-mRNA and targeting DMD, followed by Hiseq sequencing. SplicePie pipeline has been used to analyze capture-pre-mRNA-sequencing data. Analysis showed that DMD introns can be removed non-sequentially generating exon blocks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ joined blocks of exons flanked by unspliced introns. Exon blocks were detected by analysis of the coverage of paired-end reads and validated experimentally using PCR and Sanger sequencing. No correlation between intron length and speed of intron removal was observed. Computational analysis and experimental validation revealed that intron removal takes place in several steps for the majority of dystrophin introns. We found two mechanisms of multi-step intron removal in DMDÃ¢â‚¬â€œ recursive and nested splicing. Non-sequential and multi-step splicing events were found throughout the DMD gene across three cell lines. We believe that our findings of non-sequential and multi-step splicing provide insight in the splicing mechanism and will be useful to optimize therapeutic strategies that interfere with the splicing process.

Analysis of positive controls, comparisons with related methods, and statistical estimates demonstrate the high sensitivity of our approach. However, detailed analysis of putative vi- ral transcripts within neuroblastoma samples did not provide evidence for the existence of any known human viruses. Likewise, de-novo assembly and analysis of chimeric transcripts did not result in expression signatures associated with novel human pathogens. While confounding factors such as sample dilution or viral clearance in progressed tumors may mask viral cofactors in the data, in principle, this is rendered less likely by the high sensitivity of our approach and the number of biological replicates analyzed.

We mapped 14 transcriptomes of neuroblastoma as well as several positive control transcriptomes to the human and all known viral genomes in order to detect both known and unknown viruses.  Analysis of positive controls, comparisons with related methods, and statistical estimates demonstrate the high sensitivity of our approach.

We explored the order of intron removal and potential multi-step splicing for the DMD transcripts in human skeletal muscle cell lines. A customized library of probes (120bp) covering all exons and introns, has been generated capturing pre-mRNA and targeting DMD, followed by Hiseq sequencing.

Exon blocks were detected by analysis of the coverage of paired-end reads and validated experimentally using PCR and Sanger sequencing.
