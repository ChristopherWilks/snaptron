Mock Graphical User Interface
=============================

As a limited example of a downstream interface that can be built on top of the Snaptron web service interface there is the Snaptron GUI for which there are several instances for various datasets:

TCGA (~11K samples, ~36M junctions):
  http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu:8090

GTEx (~10K samples, ~30M junctions):
  http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu:8000

SRAv2 (~50K samples, ~81M junctions):
  http://snaptron.cs.jhu.edu:8443

Caveat emptor, these instances are provided as examples only for the time being.  While they serve real data and may prove useful for investigations, they are not guaranteed to be stable/performant in any way.
